display_name: Doc/BDD Governance
short_description: Keep all dev requirements stored in docs and expressed as BDD acceptance criteria; keep AGENTS.md and project docs in sync.
default_prompt: |
  Apply doc/BDD-driven governance for this change:
  1) Capture/refresh the requirement in docs/requirements (REQ-XXXX) and update docs/requirements/ledger.md.
  2) Write/refresh Gherkin scenarios under docs/bdd for acceptance criteria.
  3) Update AGENTS.md if workflow/rules change; update docs/project-doc-v1.0.md or add ADR if architecture/model changes.
  4) Only then implement code; keep changes minimal and traceable to REQ + BDD.
